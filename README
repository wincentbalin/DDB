                     ----------------------------

DDB (short for Disc DataBase) is a manager for removable media.
It was conceived as a relatively simple Perl script and was remade
in C++, as I did not want to install ActivePerl on every new Win* machine.
As with the original ddb.pl script, the program uses SQLite3.

DDB has command line interface. The list of it's command line switches
can be obtained either by calling it with the '-h'switch or without
any switches.

Currently DDB is confirmed to run also under Linux.

Compiling
---------

Currently the program compiles on Win* platform with MinGW compiler.
Linux is also supported. Users of other operating systems should feel
free to try.

Prerequisites:

0. MinGW compiler under Win*, gcc for other operating systems
1. GNU Make
2. Boost 1.46.1

Steps:

3. Get SQLite3 amalgamation and unpack the files sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h
   into the directory with DDB sources

4. If needed, choose MinGW compiler as the default one with

       /usr/sbin/alternatives --config gcc

5. Start compilation with

      make

And voila, you have the executable. Run it with

      ./ddb -h

to get acquainted with possible options.


TODO
----

* Check whether DDB is usable under Mac OS X too
