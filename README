                     ----------------------------

DDB (short for Disc DataBase) is a manager for removable media.
It was conceived as a relatively simple Perl script and was remade
in C++, as I did not want to install ActivePerl on every new Win* machine.
As with the original ddb.pl script, the program uses SQLite3.

DDB has command line interface. The list of it's command line switches
can be obtained either by calling it with the '-h'switch or without
any switches.

Currently DDB is confirmed to run also under Linux.

Compiling
---------

Currently the program compiles on Win* platform with MinGW compiler.
Linux users might want to check whether DDB compiles under Linux
(or any other UNIX) too.

Prerequisites:

0. Cygwin with MinGW compiler

Steps:

1. Get SQLite3 amalgamation and unpack it into the directory
   with DDB sources and compile it

2. If needed, choose MinGW compiler as the default one with

       /usr/sbin/alternatives --config gcc

3. Copy sqlite3.o object file into the directory with DDB sources

4. Start compilation with

      make

And voila, you have the executable. Run it with

      ./ddb -h

to get acquainted with possible options.


TODO
----

* Check whether DDB is usable under Mac OS X too
